    <p>Anthony was a curious boy with an imagination far bigger than the small town he lived in. At ten years old, he had already decided he would one day build a machine that could fly to other planets—not just the moon, but worlds no one had even named yet. His room was cluttered with bits of wire, scraps of cardboard, old toy parts, and notebooks filled with sketches of wild inventions.</p>

    <p>Anthony wasn’t the loudest in class, nor the most athletic on the playground, but if you asked a question no one else could answer, he’d be the one who stayed behind after school, trying to figure it out. His teachers noticed his quiet determination. His parents didn’t always understand his projects, but they never stopped him either.</p>

    <p>Every afternoon, Anthony would ride his bike to the edge of town, where an abandoned shed behind the library had become his secret lab. There, he’d tinker and test, break and build again. It was where dreams took shape, even if they didn’t always work—yet.</p>

    <p>He didn’t mind the failures. “Every broken piece teaches me something,” he once told his best friend Maya, who sometimes helped hold things steady while he soldered or took notes while he tested small contraptions.</p>

    <p>Anthony may have looked like just another boy with scraped knees and messy hair, but inside him lived the heart of an explorer, the mind of a scientist, and the soul of a storyteller—each invention not just a device, but a chapter in the story he was writing with his life.</p>
